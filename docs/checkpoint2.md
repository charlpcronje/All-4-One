# DCR Project Checkpoint 2

Date: June 2, 2025

## Progress Since Checkpoint 1

This checkpoint documents the progress made in the DCR (Data Communication Router) project since Checkpoint 1, focusing primarily on the completion of the Database Schema & ORM implementation tasks.

## Completed Tasks

### ORM & Database Schema

- ✅ **Schema Definition**: Verified and completed the comprehensive Drizzle schema that includes tables for:
  - Users & Permissions
  - APIs & Endpoints
  - Logs & Webhooks
  - Cache & Retry scheduling
  
- ✅ **Lifecycle Support**: Confirmed the database operations lifecycle implementation with:
  - `beforeExecute`, `execute`, and `afterExecute` hooks
  - Transaction handling with lifecycle integration
  - Support for read and write operations with proper context
  
- ✅ **Migration System**: Created a SQL-based migration system with:
  - Migration directory structure at `src/db/migrations`
  - Initial SQL migration file (`0000_initial_schema.sql`)
  - Custom migration runner that executes SQL files
  
- ✅ **Seed Script**: Enhanced the seed script to:
  - Create an admin user with appropriate privileges
  - Add an example API with configuration
  - Include a sample endpoint with settings
  - Add test users with different permission levels

### Frontend Issues

- ✅ **Fixed Deno Dependencies**: Resolved the issue with Deno and tailwindcss-animate dependency

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Database Schema & Migrations

- **`backend/src/db/schema.ts`**: Verified and confirmed table definitions for all entities
- **`backend/src/db/migrations/0000_initial_schema.sql`**: Added initial SQL migration for schema creation
- **`backend/src/scripts/migrate.ts`**: Updated to handle SQL file-based migrations
- **`backend/src/scripts/run-migrations.ts`**: Created new script for easier migration execution

### Seeding & Utilities

- **`backend/src/scripts/seed.ts`**: Fixed compatibility issues to match the schema
- **`backend/package.json`**: Updated scripts section with new migration and setup commands

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The schema implementation uses Drizzle ORM with SQLite and includes comprehensive tables for managing:

- **User Management**: Users and their permissions for API access
- **API Registry**: APIs and their endpoints with configuration
- **Monitoring**: Logs for tracking operations and webhooks for notifications
- **Performance**: Cache for response optimization and retry scheduling for failed requests

### Migration System

Rather than using drizzle-kit directly, we've implemented a custom migration runner that:

1. Scans for SQL migration files in the `src/db/migrations` directory
2. Executes them in order, splitting into individual SQL statements
3. Reports success or failures during migration process

### Database Seeding

The improved seed script creates a baseline dataset including:

- An admin user with full system access
- Regular test users with limited permissions
- A sample API with configuration JSON
- A test endpoint with caching enabled

## Next Steps

With the ORM & Database Schema tasks completed, the next areas of focus are:

1. **Logging & Persistence (Section 5)**
   - Implement database logging with phase tagging
   - Schedule daily exports to S3
   - Attach log hooks to lifecycle phases
   - Create a logs viewer backend

2. **API Imports & Mapping (Section 6)**
   - Parse Postman collections
   - Generate endpoint configurations
   - Store imported APIs and endpoints
   - Register and route imported endpoints

## Technical Notes

- The database system is now fully functional with proper schema, migrations, and seeding
- The system uses SQLite for development but could be extended to other databases supported by Drizzle
- Lifecycle hooks are implemented for both the API request flow and database operations
