# DCR Project Checkpoint 1

Date: June 2, 2025

## Project Overview

DCR (Data Communication Router) is a system designed to manage, route, and monitor API endpoints with lifecycle hooks. It consists of a TypeScript backend using Hono and Drizzle ORM, with a React frontend using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI components.

## Project Structure

```
c:\xampp\htdocs\dcr\
├── backend\       # TypeScript backend with Hono and Drizzle
├── core\          # Core functionality shared between components
├── docs\          # Project documentation and tasks
├── frontend\      # React frontend with Vite, Tailwind, and ShadCN
└── shared\        # Shared code, including Zod schemas
```

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Project Setup
- ✅ Backend project initialized with TypeScript, Hono, and Drizzle
- ✅ Frontend project initialized with Vite, React, Tailwind, and ShadCN
- ✅ Shared directory created for Zod schemas

#### 2. Environment & Configuration
- ✅ Environment variable loader and validator implemented
- ✅ Created default orchestrator configuration
- ✅ Implemented configuration merge logic

#### 3. Backend Routing & Lifecycle
- ✅ Core Hono app scaffolded with `/api` base route
- ✅ Implemented request lifecycle phases: `beforeRequest`, `request`, `afterRequest`
- ✅ Added lifecycle method chaining and conditional skipping
- ✅ Created DCR routes for built-in endpoints

### In Progress Tasks

#### 9. Frontend UI
- ⏳ ShadCN + Tailwind layout setup
- ⏳ Resolved Deno and tailwindcss-animate dependency issue

### Next Tasks

#### 4. ORM & Database Schema
- Define Drizzle schema for all tables
- Implement DB operations lifecycle
- Create migration runner
- Add seed script

### Documentation

- **`docs/tasks.md`**: Project task breakdown and progress tracking
- **`docs/design.md`**: Design decisions and architecture

## Technical Notes

### Backend

- Using Hono as the web framework for its lightweight nature and performance
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Implemented a lifecycle approach for request handling with hooks at different stages

### Frontend

- Using Vite for fast development experience
- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components for styling
- Uses D3 for data visualization

### Development Environment

- The project is developed on Windows using XAMPP
- Deno is used alongside Node.js for certain operations

## Known Issues

- There was an issue with Deno resolving the tailwindcss-animate package, which has been addressed

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the ORM & Database Schema tasks
2. Implement logging and persistence features
3. Develop API import and mapping functionality
4. Build out the frontend UI components
