### 9.5 Plugin Management

- `frontend/src/App.tsx`**: **Why?** The route for `/plugins` currently shows a placeholder. It needs to render the actual plugin management page.
- New Frontend Page (e.g., `frontend/src/pages/plugins/PluginManagementPage.tsx`)**: **Why?** This page will be the main interface for plugin management.
- [ ] 9.5.1 Plugin directory and marketplace**
    *   UI elements on `PluginManagementPage.tsx` to list available/installed plugins.
    - New Backend Endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/plugins`, `POST /api/plugins/install/:pluginId`)**: **Why?** To list plugins (from a local registry or an external source) and handle installation/uninstallation.
    - New Backend Plugin Service (e.g., `backend/src/services/plugin.service.ts`)**: **Why?** To manage plugin lifecycle, discovery, and registration.
- [ ] 9.5.2 Plugin configuration interface**
    *   UI components (possibly on `PluginManagementPage.tsx` or a dedicated plugin detail page) to configure settings for each installed plugin.
    - `backend/src/db/schema.ts` (or config files)**: **Why?** A way to store plugin configurations persistently.
    - New Backend Endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/config`, `PUT /api/plugins/:pluginId/config`)**: **Why?** To fetch and update plugin configurations.
- [ ] 9.5.3 Custom plugin creation wizard**
    *   This is a complex feature requiring a dedicated set of UI pages in the frontend for defining plugin metadata, code (perhaps a mini-editor), and configuration schema.
    *   Significant backend support would be needed to store, compile (if necessary), and register these custom plugins.
- [ ] 9.5.4 Plugin testing environment**
    *   UI in the frontend (perhaps on a plugin's detail page) to trigger test executions of a plugin with sample data.
    *   Backend logic to execute a plugin in an isolated environment and return results/logs.
